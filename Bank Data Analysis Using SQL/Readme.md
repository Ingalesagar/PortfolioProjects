## Introduction
Neo-Banks are a recent development in the financial sector; they are new
banks that solely operate online.

I believe that there should be some kind of connection between the digital world, these new-age institutions, and cryptocurrencies. So I made the decision to start a new project called Bank Data Analysis Using SQL! Customers of Data Bank receive cloud data storage allotments that are directly related to the balances in their accounts. The Data Bank team needs your assistance since this business model comes with some intriguing drawbacks.

This case study focuses on metrics calculations, business growth, and smart data analysis to assist the company in more accurately estimating and planning for the
future.
