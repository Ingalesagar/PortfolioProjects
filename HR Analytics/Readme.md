## Conclusion
- The analysis of the provided data points reveals interesting trends within the workforce for the months of April, May, and June. In April, a substantial total 
  presence percentage of 94.05% suggests a strong in-office presence. However, 9.08% WFH percentage indicates a significant number of employees working remotely. 
  Seeking leave is relatively low at 0.43%, with a noteworthy concentration of 48.54% on Thursdays. This pattern continues, as May and June demonstrate a decline 
  in total presence percentages (89.75% and 90.70%, respectively), indicating a potential shift towards more flexible work arrangements.
- The WFH percentage gradually increases from 9.08% in April to 14.20% in June, possibly indicating an increasing adoption of remote work practices. While seek 
  leave remains generally low, it increases to 1.68% in May and returns to 1.10% in June. Interestingly, Mondays in May (2.41%) and Fridays in June (2.30%) see 
  slightly higher rates of seek leave. Additionally, WFH percentages for Thursdays in April (7.80%) and Fridays in June (17.20%) stand out, highlighting particular 
  days where remote work is favored. These insights collectively illustrate a dynamic interplay between in-office presence, remote work, and leave patterns across 
  the three months.
